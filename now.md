### Doing a full time job
I work at one of the SaaS company in Indonesia remotely.

### Working on personal projects
In the mean time, I craft some web-based apps. Two of them already released: Kanyaah and Gaw√©eun. Gaw√©eun currently have no active development, since I designed it as the finished software. Some of them are still in development.

### Reading and writing blogs
I‚Äôve read a lot blogs recently. Most of them are published at the bear blog. Reading the blog posts urges me to write more blog posts again, just the good old times.

### Reading Getting Real
Getting Real is a book by 37signals. It's about how to build web application that really matters. Recently, they moved it to Writebook format. It is available online [here](https://books.37signals.com/8/getting-real){:target="blank"}. Worth to read üëç

### Start journaling
This one is a personal one. Much like a diary, lol. I write it in a simple txt files. No fancy tools.

I once did this in circa 2014, but still inconsistent. Now after 10 years, I‚Äôm doing this again.

Will I be more consistent? I don‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs just try it.

### Restarted the morning run

I used to do morning runs every weekend before I got married. To live a healthy life, I restarted to do morning runs again recently.
