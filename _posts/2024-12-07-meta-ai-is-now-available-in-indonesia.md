I am shocked. Really. I know that Meta integrates the AI within WhatsApp. I've seen the demo on Twitter, but I didn't know that today is the launch day in Indonesia.

Currently, it uses the Llama 3.2 as the model. I've given it a shot to give me suggestions about the blog posts ideas. Even though the answers to me were too generous, I still can use the answers as the source of the inspirations when I get stuck on writing.

Overall, for daily common usage, it's really good. And what's even more is that it's free and can generate images as well! People would love free stuff for sure.

Here's the result of the generated image using this prompt:

> Draw a cartoon image of a cat drawing a mountain

Even though, for developers, I am still not sure whether the Meta AI will become an alternative to ChatGPT or Claude. As of now, I think nothing could beat these two yet.
