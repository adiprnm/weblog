title: My Son Turns 2
---

Two years ago, I made [this blog post](/resmi-menjadi-ayah) after supporting my wife in giving birth to our child. It was tough. But the difficult, long struggle of giving birth paid off after we heard our son cry loudly.

It's fascinating to see his growth and development. I clearly remember the first time he responded to our cheerings: it was when we visited my parents during the Idul Fitri. I remember the first time he faced down: it was when my wife and I had a chat in the living room, along with our son by our side. I clearly remember the first time he walked: it was when I was working and suddenly, he came into my room and walked from the living room.

Now, he started to understand what we talked about. He even started to understand some simple instructions, like putting his toys in the box or turning off the lamp in the living room.

He also started to have his own will. He asked me to buy candy almost every day, to which I mostly said no for the sake of his health. This morning, after having a morning walk with his mom, he asked me to buy a ball. He saw it in the store not so far from our house. So, in the meantime of the work, we went to that store and bought one.

It's kinda unbelievable that two years have passed so quickly. And of course, having this kind of situation is such a blessing to me. I am grateful to be the dad of the adorable son.

Happy birthday, son! I wish you all the best. I am sorry if I haven't been able to be a good father to you yet.
