Gawéeun recently has no feature enhancements nor bug fixes. And it should be like this. I designed it to be simple and. useful.

Kanyaah, as of I write this post, has received a mini enhancement: guided setup of the invitation creation process. Well, it has been in my todo list for a long time, and I decided to impelement it after one of the customer complained about the invitation creation process.

That is the only enhancement I’ve done. The other process remains the same.

And, yap, both Gawéeun and Kanyaah should be the finished softwares.

After all, both of the apps have its specific domains. Gawéeun was built to solve the main problem in managing daily tasks: the task prioritization. Kanyaah was built to solve the needs of creating an invitation quickly with less hussle.

That are basically it.

So here’s my take: not every software should have bunch of features. There are softwares that intentionally have less features. They aims simplicity: less is more.

Building unnecessary features for Gawéeun and Kanyaah will against the simplicity principle. And I don’t want that. I wrote in this blog about [how I almost fall into a trap](https://adipurnm.my.id/posts/software-harus-punya-visi) when developing a feature for Gawéeun.

There are softwares that meant to be the finished softwares. Gawéeun and Kanyaah are two of them. And I think we should embrace it, as much as we embrace the console games that stored in the compact disk.
