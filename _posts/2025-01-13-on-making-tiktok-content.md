title: On Making TikTok Content
---

I published two videos on TikTok some days ago. The first video is about LocalWP. It is a free app by WPEngine that lets us run WordPress on localhost without hassle. The view was not that much. It has about 200 views.

The second one is about a coffee mug that I bought online. Yup, I made the video for TikTok affiliate purposes. I am interested in it since I think it is promising.

When scrolling the For Your Page my mug video suddenly appeared. TikTok suggested it to boost the post so it gains more engagement.

Then I checked the pricing. By paying about $3 a day, my video could be viewed by at least one thousand people and about 5,000 views at maximum. Interesting. So I gave it a shot.

The next morning, I checked the video and it had been viewed by 1000 people! 3 of them checked out the item. By the end of the day, the videos had been viewed by 3000 people.

Although the product views increased a lot, no more checks out occurred. It was probably because people didn't need it yet, or maybe it was because the video wasn't engaging enough.

Well, I didn't expect much, after all. I was just curious about the boost post feature TikTok offers. And to me, it was worth it. And it is. But depending on the boost post feature for every new content is financially unwise for a beginner like me.

I might try it for other products in the future. But for now, I am going to try the organic way. Let TikTok decide that my content is good enough to be displayed on For Your Page. I have to learn more to make my contents more engaging to the viewers.
