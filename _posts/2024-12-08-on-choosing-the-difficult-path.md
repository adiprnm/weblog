There's a saying that says:

> If you want to live your life easier, choose the difficult path.

I've been doing this for years, and I would say that it's absolutely valid.

Despite my parents' financial struggles, I pursued my dream by entering college. Fortunately, I got a scholarship, so I didn't have to worry about the tuition fees.

I did everything to generate additional income because depending on the scholarship alone was insufficient. It was tough, but now it's paid off. I graduated from college on time, landed a job right after I was about to finish my thesis.

And here I am. Enjoying the result of the difficult path I've taken, while keep improving to have more better life.

I would say that now, I am financially stable, but I know, always feeling like this is not good. I realize that something bad might happened any time.

So, I still have to prepare many things: emergency funds, children's education funds, retirement funds, etc. I still have financial goals that is not achieved yet as well.

My responsibility now is to keep the wheel from going down. Whatever it takes. As long as it doesn't harmful other people and doesn't against my religion's rules. Wish me luck!
