I read random blogs recently. I discovered the blogs by searching for them using the *blogroll 2024* keyword on Google. Some of the blog posts contained links to another blog that the authors recommended to read. Jumping from one rabbit hole to another. The retro joy resurrected.

What's good about a blog post is that it is mostly in the form of an essay, and it usually contains at least three or four paragraphs. Reading a lot of words can improve our reading comprehension.

I enjoyed reading those blog posts. It was written by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, along with their unique styles of writing. I learned a lot about how those people see something from their blog posts.

Reading blog posts to me is the cheapest and most effective way to rebuild the reading habit. The blog posts I read were published on free blogging platforms like [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com). It's accessible for free.

When it comes to finding blog posts to read, I think blogrolls are still the best way. It is made by humans, for humans. I am not an anti-AI guy, but still, when it comes to blog posts, the made-by-human blog posts have a different feel from the made-by-AI one.

Anyway, I haven't created my version of the blogroll yet. Maybe later. Let's just enjoy to write and reading more for now.
