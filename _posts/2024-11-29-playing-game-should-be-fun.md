Some time ago, I played a MOBA game on my phone to relieve my stress after work. I played classic mode, with the hope that I could play a fun game.

And guess what? The opponents played seriously. They invaded the jungle. Ganked every lanes. As if it was in a ranked game.

I told them to be more relaxed and played some fun games, but they replied:

> You must be honor-ranked.

I laughed. I mean, really? They said this in classic mode? How funny.

After the match ended, I checked the profile, and turned out that one of them were immortal-ranked. I wondered, did all immortal-ranked players couldn't play a fun game?

I think they had missed the important point of the game. A game should be fun, especially the classic mode. If every mode were so serious, then I thought it weren't worth the game. Instead of relieving stress, it only added a new one.

Maybe I should play another game. The mobile MOBA ecosystem has already too toxic.
