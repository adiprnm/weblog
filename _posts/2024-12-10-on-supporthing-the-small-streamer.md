The last time I played the MOBA game, I teamed up with a player who played only one hero. The player turned out to be a streamer. Once we played the game, he also promoted his YouTube channel to other players.

I was curious, so I checked the channel and my account is there! What an achievement, haha. There was only 1 viewer, and it was just me. But some time later, the number of viewers was increased by 4. I believe that the other viewers were players from the previous match.

Apart from the number of viewers, his gameplay was awesome. The hero's win rate is about 84%, which is cool and hard to achieve for a solo player.

We played two matches only, and we won both of them. I had to skip the remaining matches because I had something to do. After 2 hours of livestream, he finished the livestream.

It was fun. He didn't charge me to play with him. If he were a big streamer, I probably have to pay Rp100.000 rupiah. He only asked me to subscribe and like his livestream. So, I did it.

I enjoyed it when he read my chat on the live chat. That's what I like from a small streamer. All of the chats will be read by them, without having to pay Rp10.000 for each chat to be read by the streamer.

I hope my involvement in his livestream will motivate him to do the livestream.
