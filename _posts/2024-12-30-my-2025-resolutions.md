title: My 2025 resolutions
---

Well, I usually don't have specific resolutions for a year. But, in 2025, I want to try new things. I make them as resolutions, so I can keep track of my progress, and remind the future me that I have resolutions to do.

## Start to create content

My video for fun on TikTok was FYP some time ago. I didn't expect this, at all. I made that video because the filter was so fascinating. The filter is about the preferred programming language. I choose Ruby, of course.

The views blew up to 20k+, although the video quality is so ugly. I recorded it on my old phone, and the video resolution is probably 240p.

Besides that, we are entering an era where content is the new gold. A successful content creator can make hundreds or even thousands of dollars monthly, and endorsements and affiliates are the source of income.

I have a feeling this trend will last for quite a while. So, I think it's worth trying.

## Write ebook

I am in the process of writing an ebook about Ruby on Rails in Bahasa. I plan to release it in 2025, hopefully along with my other non-technical ebook.

## Write blog posts regularly

I didn't regularly write blog posts in 2023 and 2024. I wrote when I wanted to. I plan to write regularly in 2025. At least, I write one blog post a week.

## Focus more on Kanyaah

[Kanyaah](https://kanyaah.com) remains the side hustle that generates the most revenue. It's not that much, but it's enough to pay the monthly bill. I realized that I didn't pay much attention to it.

So, in 2025, I am going to take care of it more: adding more templates, gathering feedback from users, improving the SEO, etc.

## Start new boring side hustles

The last one, I want to have new boring side hustles. I wrote my motivation about the boring business [here](/the-boring-business). I've made the plan recently. I need to prepare several things before starting the business.

That's all. Wish me luck!
