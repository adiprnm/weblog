title: Watching TV isn't appealing anymore
---

I visited my parents-in-law this weekend. We watched the reality show on TV in the evening.

To be honest, I didn't feel the joy of watching TV programs anymore. It might be because I knew that everything on the TV programs, even the most sensational reality shows, behind the scenes, were scripted. Or it might be because I used to watch videos on YouTube or TikTok.

Before the era of the internet, watching television programs is the best way to spend my spare time. I could watch the television all day long on weekends or school holidays. Sometimes it played the movies I've ever watched, but still, I watched it until the end.

With the rise of social media and video-sharing platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, television programs have started to lose the competition. People started to choose the on-demand services since they could choose the content they preferred. Moreover, the For Your Page algorithm, which will deliver content that matches the user's trends based on the user's activities and interests, is now almost implemented in every social media, even Twitter as the text-based social media.

This might be one of the reasons why [ANTV and NET TV laid off their employees some time ago](https://www.dkliknews.com/nasional/34814225988/net-tv-dan-antv-phk-massal-pertanda-buruk-bagi-industri-televisi).

I still don't know the next step of the television industry to keep going on the competition with the on-demand video services. If things don't change, I worry that more layoffs will occur in the future as NET TV and ANTV did.
