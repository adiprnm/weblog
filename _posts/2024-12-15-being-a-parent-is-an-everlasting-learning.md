title: Being a parent is an everlasting learning
---

I visit my parents this weekend. It's been a long time: probably about three months since my last visit.

There are some changes in the town. The building construction at the town square is almost done. I still don't have any idea what the building is, but it looks so gorgeous.

Meanwhile, my parents' house remains the same. All of it: the situation, and the people inside of it.

We plan to stay until Monday. I took the day off of work. I want to stay a little longer: let my parents play with our son. They must miss our son, after three months of not seeing him.

They played happily, like two little kids playing together. Then I realize:

> When playing with a kid, we have to be a kid again.

It's a simple rule that I often forget. We have to be proactive as well. Talk about everything around us. Ask them the names of the things, their colors, etc. The ability to find topics to talk about and storytelling will be helpful.

It might be difficult at first. We need to lower our ego and do it again and again until we are used to it.

I am still learning to be a good parent. And will always do. Because being a parent is an everlasting learning process.
