You can get the lessons not only from book, with the words and sentences on it sometimes you feel so dizzy and confuse. You can get many lessons, especially life lesson, from your circumstance: from the floors, trees, ants, birds, and people around you.

A pedicab drivers teaches you indirectly about hard work. A tissue seller teaches you indirectly about patience. Your parents teach you sincerity, sacrifice, and the meaning of love. Even a thief who were beaten by mob, teaches you not to be a thief.

It’s all about how sensitive you are to your circumstance. We always turn the blind eyes, so that the lesson actually we can get, we don’t get it. We are too busy with our affairs, so then we don’t have much time to observe our circumstance. Or, we are too lazy to do that.

Open your eyes widely, and see, how many teachers around you. Learn everything you can learn, and apply it to your life, just for a better life.
