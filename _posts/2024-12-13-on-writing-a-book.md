I was recently thinking about writing a programming book. Well, I already made it. It's about deployment using Dokku. I put the link on the [Projects](/projects) page of this blog. Check it out, it's free.

The next books will be technical and non-technical books. The non-technical book is still ongoing, but I think I might postpone it. I need more research.

The technical book will be about programming. I plan to write the Bahasa version of the Ruby and Rails book. I realized that currently, the resources to learn Ruby and Rails in Bahasa are so limited. It is due to the popularity of Ruby and Rails in Indonesia. Laravel and JS frameworks are more popular here. Also, there's a demand from communities who prefer to learn Ruby and Rails in Bahasa. So I think it's gonna be worthwhile.

I think Rails is a great framework. It has everything we need to build modern apps: caching, storage, database versioning, background job, mailer, rich-text content and soon, markdown editor.

What's even great is that now, only with a few commands and setups, we can ship our Rails apps using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org). No vendor lock-in anymore.

Also, since Rails 8, the development becomes simpler. The Solid trifecta (Solid Queue, Solid Cache, Solid Cable) become the defaults of the new Rails app. Those are the database-backed adapters, which means, the cache, queue, and web socket are backed by the database. The rationale behind this is that nowadays, storage is becoming faster. Based on the benchmark, when compared to Redis, the Solid trifecta is fast enough.

I just can't let this treasure go undiscovered by Indonesian programmers, especially the freelancers and solopreneurs. "The One-Person Framework" philosophy aligns well with both of them.

Meanwhile, the non-technical books will be about programming and probably non-programming. The postponed book is about programming.

I may share the progress of the writing in this blog. LFG ðŸš€
