Last night, I discussed the dilemma of choosing a blogging platform (again) with my wife. I am happy with the current blog, but I think the publishing process is a bit complicated, especially when I want to add an image to the post. It is far easier when doing it from my laptop, but I enjoy writing more on my smartphone.

The [current blog](https://adipurnm.my.id) is powered by Jekyll. Hosted in the GitHub Pages. This means that when I want to add a new post, I have to add it under the `_posts` folder and put the images in the `assets` folder. Doing it from the smartphone is a real pain.

Then, I discovered [the bear blog](https://bearblog.dev). It's so nice. The creator encourages simplicity, so we can focus on writing more content. I like it.

What I like the most is the Discover page. It lists all the trending posts (yes they have an upvote mechanism to determine it), and the recent posts. It can be filtered by the country. I think this is the other missing piece of my Jekyll blog: the community.

This is great. I started to feel exhausted opening text-based social media like X. Drama everywhere. I need a calm and relaxing place. That's why I love blogging.

After trying out the bear blog, I was triggered to make a similar website. So, in the meantime, I built it. The v1 is almost there. But, I am still considering, whether to release it to the public or not.

I told her about this, and she responded: "Seems like you enjoyed making apps".

I do! Absolutely! Crafting apps gives me much pleasure. You can do whatever you want with your computer as long as you can program it. You can make an app that solves your problem.

I built [Gaweeun](https://gaweeun.my.id) because I have a problem prioritizing the work, and the available to-do list apps don't fit my mental model. Now, it does everything I need. No messy to-do list anymore. All are now well-organized.

I built [Kanyaah](https://kanyaah.com) because I want to have a side project. I migrated it to be a web app because making it in WordPress is such a pain: I have to edit the data manually since it was built using Elementor. And for every Elementor version update, some of it breaks the invitation CSS styles.

And now, I built the blogging platform because I have a hard time publishing a Jekyll blog post from my smartphone, as I mentioned above. The bear blog already solves it. But, I still want to make a similar app. The simpler one.

You know, publishing a similar app is like having Indomaret and Alfamart placed side by side. Both of them are a minimarket, and they sell the same goods categories. Both of them have their own market. And both of them are still doing very well until now.

So, most likely I will publish the app. Not until the v1 is completed, because the [v1 is for me](https://world.hey.com/jason/version-1-is-for-you-658422f3).

For now, I will just post it on both of the blogs. If you're interested, you can visit my other blog at [https://adipurnm.bearblog.dev](https://adipurnm.bearblog.dev) ðŸ‘‹
