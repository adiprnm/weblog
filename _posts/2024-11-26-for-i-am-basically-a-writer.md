I started writing when I was in senior high school. I enjoyed reading stories in Kaskus back then, and plenty of stories were written at the Stories From the Heart subforum.

Reading many of the stories triggered me to write my own version. I started by writing a collection of short stories, then tried to make a series. The ideas came from what I had experienced in life.

Writing stories was hard, really. I had to consider many things: the characterization, the overall plot, the conflict, the resolution of conflict, and so on. I always ended up making boring stories, after all.

So then I tried to write another type of writing: the essay. I was triggered when I read a blog. The author is consistent in writing a short essay almost every day, up until now! Wow. I also enjoyed reading essays from sir [Dahlan Iskan](https://dahlaniskan.wordpress.com). His writing style was so unique.

I published my article on a WordPress site. Most of it was random posts. I was still confused about what topic should I write about at the time.

In college, I wrote more code rather than essays. I think that was the best time to explore everything related to programming. I tried a lot of programming languages. I learned about networking and security as well.

In the past 4 years, almost all I did involved programming, whether it was full-time work, freelance, or my own side hustle. I built many apps. Some of them were kept unpublished, and the other apps, like [Kanyaah](https://kanyaah.com) and [Gaweeun](https://gaweeun.my.id), were published.

I also made this blogging platform by myself. Now I write the code and essays at the same time.

Come to think of it. It has been 10+ years and still counting, and I still do writing! I'm impressed by myself, haha.

Let's do this again tomorrow. Writing is fun, and it always is.
