When I coded or played a game, I always did it overnight. The sensation they gave made me keep going on. Both of them somehow gave me something like a stimulant so I could do that in many hours.

Then, I started to contemplate. I realized that this was wrong. It's hazardous for my health if I keep doing this every day. My body had alerted me to change this behavior: the acne on my face.

So, I decided and committed to shifting it earlier. I am now officially a morning person. It is great! I regret not doing this earlier.

## Feel more refreshed

The main difference between sleeping earlier and later is that it feels way more refreshing when I sleep earlier. It feels great. It's like finding something that I've missed for a long time. I used to be a morning person during my school period, tho.

Waking up earlier means I can do anything earlier as well, just like writing a blog post, reading a book, coding, or even gaming. Just like now. I started my day writing this blog post.

## The main challenges

The main challenge to sleep earlier is the urge to play a game after work. I am not such a gamer, but playing games after work is like giving myself a reward for the day.

The addiction of a game is like a tobacco. Once you enjoy it, it's hard to stop it. So I committed to play two or three games only before sleep.

So, that's the wrap. This is just the beginning. Let's repeat it tomorrow.
