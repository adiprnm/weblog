Every time I look at the picture taken in the early 1900s, or listen to the music from the ’90s through early ’20s, and realize that I am now living in 2024, a profound feeling fills me up. It’s like “Wow, 20+ years has passed already? Unbelievable!”.

I still clearly remember when I was 5, I loved playing the Duck Hunt game on my NES. Shooting those ducks like a pro. I’d ask my grandma to buy a new Nintendo cartridge everytime we visited her. If grandma didn’t allow me to buy it, no worries - I have my ace card: crying out load until she gave up. Haha.

I remember when I asked my mom to buy a PlayStation 1 and 2. Some days later, after I came back from school, the PlayStation I asked for was neatly installed in the living room. That was one of the happiest day ever in my life. I got so addicted to it, playing it all day long, until my mom had to turned off the electricity in our house by force. Haha.

Then there were the junior high school days, when I first saw a search engine named Google. You could find almost everything you wanted to search for. My teacher searched for “rorombeheun” and it displayed all related information: the pictures, and the articles. Awesome!

I also remember when I first got into blogging. Not as a writer, but as a javascript-copy-pasta-expert, haha. Who cared about the blog content - I could copy-paste it from another blog. All I cared is about the fancy animation and widgets: that marquee and text-wriggling-and-following-the-cursor thing is really cool. I even became the 2nd-place winner of a blogging design contest in my city back then, with all the drama that came with it.

So many things happened in the past 20 years. It feels like yesterday. Now, I am already married to a woman I love, have an adorable son, and enjoy my current role as a father and husband. The good old days will always have a special place in my heart. Those were the best days to live in.
