I have asked Claude and ChatGPT more often recently. They helped me a lot to do my job.

I even asked some random questions to them, like the performance comparison of two tech stacks when handling 1000 concurrent connections, in terms of memory usage. I know it's silly since I don't know how the actual benchmarking process they've done, but I find it satisfying every time I do this, lol.

I use Canva for making visual content. Canva I think is a game-changer in the design world. It provides us so many templates and elements. For a non-designer person like me, the templates and elements they provided are really helpful.

I use Grammarly to refine my writing. The grammar and typing error checker was great. Helped me a lot to make my writing better to read and understand.

I use Codeium to assist me in coding. Really handful when I write some tests, or when I am too lazy to type the code.

We all know that we have to subscribe to the services if we want to use the premium features of those apps. And I use the free version for all of those apps.

As of now, I still don't have the urge to upgrade the services to the paid ones. The free services, so far, are enough.

Subscribing to the premium features when my needs doesn't that much to me it's not a wise choice. I don't like it. Cost efficiency matters to me.

So let's enjoy the free version first. Once I really need the service, I'll subscribe without thinking twice.
